# GBA RTS Patcher(**not working right now**)

This project provides automatic Real-Time Save (RTS) functionality for GBA games running on SRAM flash carts. It allows players to save and restore game state at any time using button combinations.




## Features

- **Real-Time Save**: Press L+R+START to save current game state
- **Real-Time Load**: Press L+R+SELECT to restore previously saved state
- **Automatic patching**: Automatically detects game type and injects appropriate save code
- **Multiple flash chip support**: Compatible with various flash cart types

## How it Works

The patcher injects custom code into your GBA ROM that:
1. Hijacks the interrupt handler to detect button combinations
2. Saves complete game state (CPU registers, RAM, VRAM, etc.) to flash storage
3. Restores game state seamlessly when requested

## Requirements

The cart must have at least 64KB of SRAM. The 32KB of SRAM carts don't have enought space to save.(but this can be fix, I just don't have time to do so)
## Usage

```bash
./patcher input.gba
```

For GUI users, drag the ROM onto the .exe in the file browser.

## Building

Requirements:
- devkitARM toolchain
- Standard GCC compiler

Build command:
```bash
./build.sh
```

## Contributing

Currently, the Flash programming part isn't optimized, and only supports 4 types of Flash, I hope someone can optimize this part.
